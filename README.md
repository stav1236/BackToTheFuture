# BackToTheFuture

## Background:
During my initial role as a software developer in the Apollo team, I underwent a comprehensive training program aimed at enhancing my independent learning skills and gaining in-depth knowledge of the team's technologies.

## Description:
This project delves into the fundamentals of web development, exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for client-side development, as well as diving into server-side development using Java Spark.

The project is divided into three distinct parts:

- **Tar1-hazarim**: In this phase, the focus was on mastering HTML and CSS to build the client-side components of the project.

- **Tar2-Clock**: Building upon the foundation laid in the first phase, Tar2 introduced JavaScript for dynamic client-side interactions, adding functionality to the project.

- **Spark-Tar3**: The final phase of the project involved interfacing with a Java Spark server and MongoDB database. This part emphasized integrating server-side logic with the client-side components developed earlier, creating a cohesive web application.
